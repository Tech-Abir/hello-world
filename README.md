# Overview
A minimal static web page that displays a centered "Hello World" heading on a solid blue background. It is fully responsive and works in any modern browser.

# Setup
No build steps are required.

- Option 1: Open the file directly
  - Double-click index.html to open it in your default web browser.

- Option 2: Serve with a simple static server (optional)
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server` and visit http://localhost:8000
  - Node (serve): `npx serve` and visit the provided URL

# Usage
Open index.html in any modern web browser. The page will show a blue background with the "Hello World" heading centered on the screen.

# Improvements from previous version (Round 2)
- Added a solid blue background across the full viewport.
- Ensured the heading is centered using modern CSS (grid with place-items: center).
- Improved readability and contrast with white text on blue.
- Kept a clean, responsive layout with accessible semantics.
